# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Enhancing Heart Disease Prediction Using Neural Networks and Explainable AI for Personalized Risk Assessment in Healthcare.
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including heart disease, remain one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of heart disease risk is crucial for enabling timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. While machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly neural networks, have demonstrated high potential in predicting heart disease, the lack of interpretability of these models presents a significant challenge in their adoption in clinical settings. Healthcare professionals require not only accurate predictions but also transparent, explainable insights to trust and apply AI-driven recommendations.
This research aims to enhance heart disease prediction by combining neural networks with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), to offer interpretable predictions. We propose a neural network model trained on a comprehensive dataset containing clinical features such as age, cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and exercise habits. The model’s decision-making process is explained through SHAP, which highlights the contribution of each feature to the prediction of heart disease. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV is applied to optimize the model’s performance, achieving a test accuracy of 86%.
The results demonstrate that combining neural networks with SHAP-based explainability enhances model accuracy while ensuring that the decision-making process remains interpretable and transparent. This approach allows healthcare professionals to better understand how individual features contribute to the prediction of heart disease risk, thus promoting trust in AI-driven tools for clinical decision-making. This research contributes to advancing the use of AI in healthcare, highlighting the importance of explainable AI in improving patient outcomes and enabling the seamless integration of AI tools in healthcare settings.
